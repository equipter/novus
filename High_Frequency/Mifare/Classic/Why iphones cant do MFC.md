# Why iPhones cannot do Mifare Classic 
*Have any questions or want to contribute to this doc add me on Discord, Equip#1515*

NXP Mifare Classic are essentially 'proprietary'  They don't conform to the "NFC Forum" specifications of what an NFC Tag is (Technically making them not NFC but thats pedantic) and because of this, only reader/writer chips made by NXP can communicate with them. The iPhone's NFC R/W chip isnt made by NXP therefore cannot communicate with it. this is a software/firmware limitation and not a hardware limitation. 

This can be skirted by Jailbreaking the iphone. Currently aemulo is one of the available apps for reading and emulating
